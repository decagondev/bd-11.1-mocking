## Meta-Mocking

Form groups of two or three. Together, you will execute unit tests for
`ATALearningProcess` in a way similar to the unit testing framework.
In this process, weâ€™ll be testing the `ask()` method, which allows a participant
to ask a question and chooses a clear answer from multiple AdviceSources,
such as instructors and mentors.

Choose one person to perform the role of `ATALearningProcess`, the unit being tested.
The other partner(s) will play the role of the unit testing framework,
using worksheets to keep track of the mock objects.
Instructors will play the role of any non-mocked objects.
We will switch roles after executing each test (although instructors will always be the `Instructor`s). 

The instructors will demonstrate the responsibilities of each role.
Once they're done, open the file described in your role sheet.
