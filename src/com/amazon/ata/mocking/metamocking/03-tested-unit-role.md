### Class Under Test Role

Pull the latest `ATAClassroomSnippets` revisions and examine the *code* in
`com.amazon.ata.mocking.metamocking.ATALearningProcess`.

For these activities, you will be the `ATALearningProcess` object,
your partner(s) will be the mock objects,
and ATA instructors will be everything else.

* Wait for your partner(s) to call you.
When they call either a constructor or method, they should also tell
you the value or the memory address of each parameter being passed in.
Take a note of the type, variable name, and memory address of these
objects on your worksheet.

  * Execute the called code.
    When you need to call a method on an object you have a memory
    address for, ask your partner(s). For instance, you might say,
    "Call `inquire()` with "What should I *not* mock?" on 1D0."
    * Any objects not represented by your partner(s) will be played by instructors.

* Join your partner(s) to execute the THEN section of the unit test together.
